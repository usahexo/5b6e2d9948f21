#  Nevada Leads The Way In Legalized Online Gambling

Nevada has been a hub for gambling activity in the United States for many years. This is due, in part, to the fact that Nevada was one of the first states to legalize gambling. In fact, gambling was legalized in Nevada all the way back in 1931.

More recently, Nevada has been at the forefront of the movement to legalize online gambling. In 2013, Nevada became the first state to pass a law legalizing online gaming. The law allows casinos in Nevada to offer online poker and other casino games to residents of the state.

The passage of this law was seen as a major victory for the online gambling industry. It showed that states were willing to legalize online gambling, and it pave the way for other states to follow suit.

Since then, several other states have legalized online gambling. These states include Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. All of these states have passed laws that allow casinos within their borders to offer online gambling games to their residents.

It is believed that more states will follow suit in the coming years. This is because there is growing support for online gambling among lawmakers and the general public. The growth of mobile gaming has also helped to fuel this trend, as more people are now comfortable playing casino games on their phones and tablets.

As more and more states legalize online gambling, it is likely that we will see a significant increase in revenue from this industry. This is good news for casinos and players alike, as it means that players will have more options when it comes to playing casino games online.

#  Delaware becomes Second State to Legalize Online Gambling

On June 5, 2018, Delaware became the second state in the US to legalize online gambling. This move comes after the US Supreme Court repealed the federal ban on sports betting in May.

The new law allows players 21 and over to gamble on casino games, including slots, table games and poker, through approved platforms such as casinos, racetracks and off-track betting facilities. Players must be physically located in Delaware to place bets.

Prior to the repeal of the federal ban, only Nevada offered legal online gambling. Since then, a number of states have introduced or passed bills legalizing some form of online gambling.

Delaware's new law is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year. It is also expected to create hundreds of jobs in the casino and technology industries.

#  New Jersey Becomes Third State To Legalize Online Gambling

On Thursday, October 25th, 2018, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law legalizing online gambling in the state. This makes New Jersey the third state in the US to legalize online gambling, following Nevada and Delaware.

The new law allows for both internet poker and casino games to be played from within New Jersey's borders. Players must be physically located in the state in order to participate. However, out-of-state players will also be able to bet on New Jersey's online casino games.

Governor Murphy stressed that the new law would create jobs and bring additional revenue to the state. "This is about generating revenue for our state, creating jobs in our state, and bringing people back into our casinos," he said at a signing ceremony.

New Jersey's online gambling market is expected to generate $260 million in revenue in its first full year of operation, according to industry analysts. That number is expected to grow over time as more people become comfortable with gambling online.

The new law goes into effect on January 23rd, 2019.

#  Pennsylvania and California Poised to Follow Suit

Pennsylvania and California have both signaled their intent to follow the lead of Massachusetts in legalizing recreational marijuana. Both states have budgetary concerns that are being addressed through the potential taxation of marijuana sales.

The Pennsylvania legislature is currently considering a bill to legalize recreational marijuana. This bill was introduced by State Representative Jake Wheatley back in February. The Republican leadership in the state has been hesitant to support the bill, but that may be changing.

Governor Tom Wolf has come out in favor of legalization and he is working with the legislature to come up with a proposal that can pass. One sticking point is how much money the state can bring in through taxes on marijuana sales.

The state is looking at an estimate of $580 million per year if it legalizes recreational marijuana. That could go a long way in helping to address Pennsylvaniaâ€™s budgetary woes.

California is also looking to legalize recreational marijuana in order to help its budget crisis. There has been some speculation that California might wait until after the November elections to pass the bill, as it could bring in more tax revenue then.

So far, there does not appear to be any opposition to legalizing marijuana in California. The only question seems to be how much money the state will bring in from taxes on sales.

Both states are facing significant budget crises and are looking for ways to increase tax revenue. Legalizing recreational marijuana appears to be a viable solution for both states.

#  More States Poised To Legalize Online Gambling in Wake of Nevada, Delaware Decisions

The recent decisions by the states of Nevada and Delaware to legalize online gambling have led to speculation that more states will follow suit. The fact that online gambling can now be conducted in a regulated environment is seen as a major step forward for the industry, and it is expected that this will lead to increased revenue for the states involved.

There are a number of reasons why online gambling is likely to be legalized in more states in the near future. Firstly, there is growing public acceptance of online gambling, with many people seeing it as a convenient way to enjoy their favourite casino games. Secondly, there is evidence that regulating online gambling can bring significant economic benefits to states, as has been shown by the experience of Nevada and Delaware.

Finally, the decision by the US Department of Justice to rescind its 2011 opinion that online gambling was illegal has removed a key obstacle to legalization. This change in policy means that states are now free to regulate and tax online gambling within their borders, which should provide a boost to state revenues.

All of these factors suggest that online gambling will continue to grow in popularity, and that more states will legalize it in the near future. This should lead to increased revenue for state governments, and a better experience for players who enjoy gambling online.
