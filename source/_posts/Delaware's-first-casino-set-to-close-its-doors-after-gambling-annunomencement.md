#  Delaware's first casino set to close its doors after gambling annunomencement

The closure of Delaware's first casino is a sign that the state's gambling announcement may not be as good for the industry as initially thought.

The announcement in June that Delaware would allow table games at its three casinos was meant to help the ailing industry. But it now appears that the move may have come too late.

The Casino at Delaware Park, which opened in 1995, will close its doors at the end of October. The casino has been struggling for years and its closure is blamed partially on the state's new gambling policy.

Delaware Park is not the only casino to feel the effects of the new policy; both Harrington Raceway and Dover Downs have seen a decline in revenue since table games were introduced.

It is hoped that the introduction of iGaming in Delaware will help to offset some of these losses, but it is still too early to tell if this will be the case.

#  What does this mean for the casino industry?

The world of iGaming is changing with the legalization of cannabis in Canada. What does this mean for the casino industry?

There are a few potential implications of this move. For one, it could create a new market for the industry as people who are now allowed to use cannabis may choose to do so at a casino. This could lead to an increase in gambling activity among this demographic.

 Additionally, cannabis could be used as an advertising tool to attract players to casinos. As more jurisdictions legalize cannabis, it’s likely that we’ll see casinos attempt to capitalize on this by including it in their marketing efforts.

Of course, there are also some risks associated with cannabis legalization. One is that it could lead to increased problem gambling rates among those who use cannabis. Additionally, there is the possibility that casinos will be used as conduits for money laundering operations involving cannabis proceeds.

All in all, the legalization of cannabis in Canada is likely to have a mixed impact on the casino industry. While there are some risks associated with the move, there are also potential opportunities for growth. It will be interesting to see how casinos and other iGaming operators respond in the coming years.

#  Maryland Live! Casino to close amid Pennsylvania gambling annunomencement

 Maryland Live! Casino, one of the largest casinos in the country, is set to close its doors next month as Pennsylvania moves forward with its own gambling plans.

The casino has been in operation since 2012 and employs over 4,000 people, but will soon be forced to close its doors as Pennsylvania moves forward with its own gambling plans.

Pennsylvania's gaming legislation was passed in October 2017 and permits casinos to operate slot machines, table games, and a variety of other gambling options. The state has also moved to authorize sports betting, which is expected to provide a major boost to the industry.

The impact of Pennsylvania's gambling expansion has already been felt in neighboring states. New Jersey gaming officials reported a 9.5% decline in casino revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017, while Delaware reported a 1.3% decline.

Maryland Live! Casino is not the only casino to be affected by Pennsylvania's gaming legislation. The recently opened Hollywood Casino in York, PA is also expected to close its doors due to competition from the new casinos in the state.

#  Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City to close amid New Jersey gambling annunomencement

The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, located in Atlantic City, announced on Wednesday that it will close its doors amid the New Jersey gambling annunomencement. The closure of the casino is expected to impact nearly 3,000 employees.

"This is a sad day for everyone at Borgata," said Marcus Glover, President and Chief Operating Officer of Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa. "We are committed to doing everything we can to help our employees during this difficult time."

This comes as a blow to the city of Atlantic City which has been struggling economically in recent years. The closure of the casino is just one more hit to an already struggling city.

#  Casino closures across the Northeast attributed to increasing competition

As gambling options have proliferated in the Northeast, a number of casinos have closed in the past year. The latest to announce its closure is the Mohegan Sun Pocono in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. It joins a long list of shuttered casinos, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut.

The closures are being blamed on an increasing competitive environment as more states have legalized gambling in recent years. The Northeast has been a hotbed of casino growth, with 13 states now offering some form of legal gambling. That's compared to just four states a decade ago.

"The market is just becoming saturated," said Joe Weinert, executive vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting firm that specializes in the gambling industry. "There are just too many casinos."

The competition has been especially fierce in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which have the most casinos of any state in the region. Pennsylvania has 12 casinos, while New Jersey has nine. Connecticut has five casinos and Massachusetts four.

Many of the closures have come amid financial difficulties for their parent companies. The Mohegan Sun Pocono casino is owned by Mohegan Sun Entertainment LLC, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year. The Foxwoods Resort Casino is owned by MGM Resorts International, which is also struggling financially. MGM recently announced it would lay off thousands of workers due to weak earnings.

The trend of casino closures is not limited to the Northeast. Gambling companies are also shutting down operations in other parts of the country due to increasing competition. In August, Illinois' largest casino shuttered its doors after only three years in business due to competition from neighboring states with more casinos. And this week, Delaware's only casino announced it would close next month due to dwindling profits.
