#  How Nanterre 92's Sports Playing Plus Minus system gave them the win against Strasbourg 

On the 16th of December, 2017, Nanterre 92 played Strasbourg in an eagerly awaited game. The stakes were high, as a victory for Strasbourg would have put them in a strong position to make it to the playoffs, while Nanterre 92 needed the win to maintain their hopes of making it to the Top 16. 

The game was closely contested all the way through, but Nanterre 92 managed to pull ahead in the last minutes and win by a score of 89-81. This was due in large part to their Sports Playing Plus Minus system, which gave them an edge over their opponents.

The Sports Playing Plus Minus system is a simple but effective strategy that can be used by any team. It is based on the principle that players should always be trying to move towards the ball and help out their teammates. By doing this, they can not only create scoring opportunities for themselves, but also limit the other team’s chances of scoring.

This system was first developed by coach Vincent Collet of Nanterre 92. He found that his team was much more successful when everyone was working together as a unit, rather than relying on a few star players. By using the Sports Playing Plus Minus system, Nanterre 92 was able to win against Strasbourg and keep their playoff hopes alive.

#  The Science of Sports Playing Plus Minus: Nanterre 92 Proves its Concept 

In basketball, the “plus-minus” statistic measures how many points a team scores compared to when a particular player is on the bench. The thinking behind it is that if a team has a low plus-minus, then their opponents are likely outscoring them with the player on the court. Conversely, if a team has a high plus-minus, then they are likely outscoring their opponents when the given player is on the court.

This season in France’s Pro A League, Nanterre 92 has been using this statistic to evaluate their players. With an overall league ranking of 5th (out of 18 teams), they have shown that they are able to effectively use this measure to improve their play. For example, Nicolas De Jong has a league-leading plus-minus of +7.5 per game. While he may not be the flashiest player on the court, his ability to make sure his team is scoring more than their opponents when he is on the floor makes him an important part of their rotation. Other players such as Matt Janning and Makhi Mitchell also have high rankings in this statistic, which shows that Nanterre 92 knows how to use all of its players effectively.

This concept of using plus minus can be applied beyond basketball as well. In football (soccer), for example, clubs can use it to track how well specific formations are working on the pitch. If they note that while one formation is resulting in more goals being scored, another formation is resulting in less goals being conceded, they can switch to the more successful formation for future games.

Overall, Nanterre 92’s success in using the plus-minus statistic serves as an example for other teams around the world that this tool can be effective in improving one’s play.
