#  In Black Jack, What is a Push Wilson?

A push Wilson is when the player and dealer have the same value card. In Black Jack, it's considered a tie and both players neither win nor lose money.

#  How to Play Push Wilson in Black Jack

Push Wilson is a blackjack side bet that pays 6 to 1 when the player’s first two cards total 12. The bet can be made independently of the main blackjack game.

To play Push Wilson, place a bet on the spot marked 'Push Wilson' in addition to your normal blackjack bet. If your first two cards total 12, you win 6 times your bet amount. If your first two cards do not total 12, you lose your Push Wilson bet.

Some casinos allow players to double down on their Push Wilson bet, just as they can with their regular blackjack bet. In this case, if the player’s first two cards do not total 12, the player loses both bets - the Push Wilson and regular blackjack bets.

#  What are the Odds of a Push Wilson in Black Jack?

## Introduction

In blackjack, a push is a tie. This means that the player and the dealer have the same point value. In this article, we are going to discuss what the odds of a push are in blackjack.

## The Odds of a Push in Black Jack

The odds of a push in blackjack vary depending on the game variation you are playing and the rules that are being used. Generally, the odds of a push are around 9 percent. This means that out of every 100 hands played, nine will result in a push.

There are some variations where the odds of a push can be higher or lower. For example, if both the player and dealer have an ace as their first card, the odds of a push increase to around 17 percent. If neither player nor dealer has an ace as their first card, then the odds of a push decrease to around six percent.

There are also different rules that can impact the odds of a push. For instance, if there is split allowed then the odds of a push will be lower because there is more opportunity for players to achieve 21 points. Similarly, if doubling down is allowed then the odds of a push will be higher because it is more likely that players will end up with more than 21 points.

#  Can You Win with a Push Wilson in Black Jack?

Can you win with a push Wilson in black jack? The answer is yes, but the odds are against you.

In black jack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. A player wins by having a higher total than the dealer, without going over 21. If both the player and the dealer have the same total, the hand is called a push and the player gets his or her money back.

If you have a push Wilson in black jack, your best option is to hit. This increases your chances of winning by giving you another card that can help you get closer to 21.

#  What is the Best Strategy for Playing Push Wilson in Black Jack?

There are a few different techniques that can be used when playing Push Wilson in black jack. One popular strategy is to always hit when your hand is below 12, and to stand when your hand is 12 or higher. Another strategy is to stand on all hands of 17 or more, and to hit on all other hands.
