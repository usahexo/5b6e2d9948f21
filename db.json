is the GDP of Poland","date":"2022-08-12T11:05:36.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What is the GDP of Poland?\n\nThe GDP of Poland is about $ 1.103 trillion as of 2019, making it the sixth largest economy in the European Union. The country’s GDP per capita is $27,700. In 2016, the Polish economy grew by 3.8%, and it is expected to grow by 3.3% in 2017. \n\nPoland has a strong industrial sector, which makes up about 38% of its GDP. The country is a major exporter of goods, with exports totaling $236 billion in 2017. Major export items include machinery, vehicles, and chemical products. Poland also has a thriving services sector, which accounts for 54% of its GDP. The country’s largest service industries are financial services, telecommunications, and tourism. \n\nThe Polish economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, thanks to reforms undertaken by the government and a booming services sector. However, rapid growth has led to some overheating concerns, and the government has been taking measures to cool down the economy. In addition, Poland faces some structural challenges such as high levels of public debt and a weak labor market. \n\nDespite these challenges, the Polish economy is expected to continue growing at a healthy pace over the next few years. This will provide opportunities for businesses both in Poland and abroad seeking to expand into this vibrant market.\n\n#  What is the population of Poland?\n\nAs of 2019, the population of Poland is 38,553,957.\n\nPoland is a country located in Central Europe.
