      <h1 id="Couple-Wins-3M-at-Casino-to-Pay-off-Taxes"><a href="#Couple-Wins-3M-at-Casino-to-Pay-off-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Couple Wins $3M at Casino to Pay off Taxes"></a>Couple Wins $3M at Casino to Pay off Taxes</h1><p>Most people are usually unhappy about having to pay taxes, but for one lucky couple in the US, their tax burden has just become a lot lighter. The couple, who have chosen to remain anonymous, won a cool $3M playing at their local casino, and have announced that they will use the money to pay off their tax bill in full.</p>
<p>The news of the windfall has thrilled the local community, with many people congratulating the couple on their good fortune. It is still not clear exactly how they won the money, as they have declined to comment further on the matter. However, whatever method they used, it clearly worked as they now have no more financial worries.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that somebody has managed to use gambling as a means of erasing their tax debt. Back in 2016, an unnamed British man managed to win £1M at a casino and used the money to clear his £120K tax bill. And while it’s definitely not advisable to try and use gambling as a way of dodging your responsibilities, it’s hard not to be impressed by these lucky winners.</p>
<p>So far, the couple has said little about what they plan to do with their new-found wealth. They have hinted that they might use some of it to buy a new home, but other than that they are remaining tight-lipped about their plans. Whatever they choose to do, you can be sure that they will enjoy every minute of it!</p>
<h1 id="Google-Minesweeper-Tax-Payments-Reach-1-3M"><a href="#Google-Minesweeper-Tax-Payments-Reach-1-3M" class="headerlink" title="Google Minesweeper Tax Payments Reach $1.3M"></a>Google Minesweeper Tax Payments Reach $1.3M</h1><p>The Google Minesweeper tax payments totaled $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, up from $900,000 in the first quarter, according to a recent report by The Verge.</p>
<p>The game, which was released in May 2019, is one of Google’s most popular new games, with over 10 million users. In order to play the game, users must watch a five-second ad.</p>
<p>Google has not yet released any information on how much it pays to ad buyers for the game ads. However, given that the average CPM for video ads is about $18, it is likely that Google is making a significant amount of money from the ads in the game.</p>
<p>The increasing popularity of the Google Minesweeper game is good news for Google, as it allows the company to continue to increase its revenue from ad sales.</p>
<h1 id="Couple-Wins-Big-in-Casino-to-Settle-Tax-Bills"><a href="#Couple-Wins-Big-in-Casino-to-Settle-Tax-Bills" class="headerlink" title="Couple Wins Big in Casino to Settle Tax Bills"></a>Couple Wins Big in Casino to Settle Tax Bills</h1><p>Bob and Cindy had been struggling to make ends meet for months. The bills were piling up, and they had no idea how they were going to pay them all off. Bob had lost his job, and Cindy wasn’t making enough money as a hair stylist to cover all the expenses. So when they heard about the casino in town, they decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>The first few hours were not very successful. But then, finally, after hours of gambling, they hit the jackpot. They won over $100,000! This was more than enough money to cover their bills and then some. They were so happy and relieved that they could finally stop worrying about their finances.</p>
<p>However, they knew that they would have to report their winnings to the IRS. And since they weren’t exactly wealthy people, this meant that they would be paying a lot of taxes on their windfall. But they didn’t mind; it was worth it to be able to finally get out of debt.</p>
<p>And so Bob and Cindy went from being essentially broke to being millionaires overnight. It was definitely an exciting turn of events!</p>
<h1 id="1-3M-Paid-in-Taxes-from-Google-Minesweeper-Winnings"><a href="#1-3M-Paid-in-Taxes-from-Google-Minesweeper-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="$1.3M Paid in Taxes from Google Minesweeper Winnings"></a>$1.3M Paid in Taxes from Google Minesweeper Winnings</h1><p>In early October, Google announced that a British man had won about $1.3 million in its “Minesweeper” game. The man, who has chosen to remain anonymous, says he plans to use the money to buy a new house and car.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this isn’t the first time someone has won big playing Minesweeper on Google. In 2012, another British man won nearly $1 million.</p>
<p>So just how much do you have to win in order to trigger a payday from Google? Apparently, it takes quite a bit. According to reports, the company only pays out jackpots of over $1,000.</p>
<p>This begs the question: why does Google offer games like Minesweeper and Pac-Man if it’s not actually going to pay out any significant prizes?</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, the games are actually quite popular with users. And by offering them, Google is able to improve its standing in the search engine rankings. This is because people who play these games tend to stick around on Google longer than they would otherwise. This increased engagement helps keep people locked in to Google’s ecosystem and makes them more likely to perform searches and click on ads.</p>
<p>So even though you might not be able to win millions from playing Minesweeper on Google, the game still serves an important purpose for the company.</p>
<h1 id="Couple-Uses-Casino-Winnings-to-Settle-Tax-Bill"><a href="#Couple-Uses-Casino-Winnings-to-Settle-Tax-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Couple Uses Casino Winnings to Settle Tax Bill"></a>Couple Uses Casino Winnings to Settle Tax Bill</h1><p>In 2012, a Massachusetts couple hit a $4.3 million jackpot at Twin River Casino in Lincoln, Rhode Island. At the time, they were given the choice of taking their winnings in cash or as a annuity over 26 years. The couple chose the annuity, which paid them just over $174,000 per year.</p>
<p>This week, however, they decided to take a lump sum payment of $2.5 million, which after taxes amounted to $1.86 million. They then used that money to pay off their federal and state income tax bill from 2012 – leaving them with exactly nothing.</p>
<p>While it may not seem like the smartest financial decision, it’s hard to fault the couple for wanting to get rid of such a large tax bill. It is estimated that they will end up paying over $300,000 in taxes on their winnings, meaning they will have effectively paid over 50% of their winnings in taxes.</p>
<p>Still, it’s always risky when large sums of money are involved, and the couple would have been better off if they had consulted with an accountant before making any decisions.</p>
