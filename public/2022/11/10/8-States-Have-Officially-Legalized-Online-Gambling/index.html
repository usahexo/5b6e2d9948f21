      <h1 id="8-States-Have-Officially-Legalized-Online-Gambling"><a href="#8-States-Have-Officially-Legalized-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="8 States Have Officially Legalized Online Gambling"></a>8 States Have Officially Legalized Online Gambling</h1><p>Within the United States, there are eight states that have now legalized some form of online gambling. At this point, it’s legal to gamble online within these states: Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Louisiana.</p>
<p>The first state to legalize online gambling was Delaware in 2013. The process for legalization began when the state’s Senate passed a bill that allowed for both casino games and poker to be played online. Not long after, Nevada followed suit and also legalized both casino games and poker.</p>
<p>New Jersey was the next state to legalize online gambling and they did so by passing a bill that permitted casinos in Atlantic City to offer games such as slots, blackjack, and roulette to players within the state.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania legalized online gambling in October 2017. The state permits both casino games and poker to be played online and it’s estimated that there are around 2 million Pennsylvanians who participate in some form of illegal gambling each year. So far, the Pennsylvania lottery is the only organization that has applied for an internet gaming license. </p>
<p>Michigan was the next state to legalize online gambling and they did so with a bill that allows for both casino games and poker to be played on websites operated by licensed providers. The law went into effect in December 2018 and Michigan is currently in the process of developing regulations for licensing these websites.</p>
<p>Indiana became the sixth state to legalize online gambling when Governor Eric Holcomb signed a bill into law in March 2019. The new law allows both casino games and poker sites to be offered through licensed providers. </p>
<p>Illinois followed suit in June 2019 when Governor JB Pritzker signed a bill into law making it legal for residents of Illinois to gamble on approved sites. This law allows for both casino games and sports betting to take place online.  </p>
<p>Louisiana was the most recent state to legalize online gambling when Governor John Bel Edwards signed a bill into law in July 2019. The new law allows people living within Louisiana borders to gamble on approved websites offering casino games, poker, or sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-The-Way-In-Regulating-And-Legalizing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-The-Way-In-Regulating-And-Legalizing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads The Way In Regulating And Legalizing Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Leads The Way In Regulating And Legalizing Online Gambling</h1><p>In 2013, the Nevada state legislature became the first in the United States to pass a law legalizing online gambling. The bill allowed for online poker and gambling within the state, but did not allow for players to gamble on sites outside of Nevada. This measure was seen as a way to help regulate and control the industry, while also providing much-needed revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>Since then, other states have followed Nevada’s lead and legalized various forms of online gambling. In 2016, Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the US to legalize online casino games. That same year, New Jersey became the first state to legalize online sports betting. And in 2018, Michigan became the sixth state to legalize internet poker and gambling.</p>
<p>Throughout all of this, Nevada has remained at the forefront of regulating and legalizing online gambling. The state has continued to update its laws to keep up with new technologies and trends in the industry. In 2017, for example, Nevada passed a law allowing for mobile gaming devices such as smartphones and tablets to be used for online gambling purposes.</p>
<p>This track record makes Nevada an ideal place for companies in the online gambling industry. With so many states now legalizing online gambling, it can be difficult for companies to navigate the regulatory landscape. But Nevada’s well-established laws make it easier for companies to do business in this state.</p>
<p>Nevada’s leadership in regulating online gambling is also good news for consumers. By legalizing and regulating this industry, states are able to ensure that players are protected from scams and fraudsters. They can also ensure that players are getting a fair deal when they gamble online.</p>
<p>This is important, as not all states have taken these measures to protect consumers. In some cases, unscrupulous operators have taken advantage of consumers by offering fake games or refusing to pay out winnings. By legalizing online gambling, states can provide a safer and more trustworthy environment for players.</p>
<p>Overall, Nevada’s leadership in regulating online gambling has been a great success story. The state has been able to harness new technologies while also protecting consumers from harm. This makes Nevada an attractive place for companies looking to get into the online gambling space, and it also benefits consumers by providing a safe and secure environment for them to gamble in</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Joins-Nevada-In-Allowing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Joins-Nevada-In-Allowing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Joins Nevada In Allowing Online Gambling"></a>Delaware Joins Nevada In Allowing Online Gambling</h1><p>Delaware has become the second state in the US to allow regulated online gambling, following Nevada’s lead. The news was announced by Delaware Governor Jack Markell on Tuesday, with the new law set to come into effect on September 1st.</p>
<p>Under the new law, internet casinos and poker rooms will be licensed and regulated by the Delaware Lottery. Residents of Delaware over 21 years of age will be able to gamble at these sites, which are expected to offer a range of games including slots, blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>Governor Markell is confident that the new law will be a boon for the state’s economy, estimating that it could generate as much as $7 million in annual tax revenue. He also believes that it will create around 100 jobs in the state’s nascent online gambling industry.</p>
<p>The news comes as something of a surprise, as Delaware was one of six states that originally opposed online gambling legalization. However, in February this year the state reversed its position and introduced legislation to legalize it.</p>
<p>Nevada became the first US state to legalize online gambling in February 2013. The move has proven to be a success, with revenues from regulated internet casinos and poker rooms reaching over $20 million in 2014.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Enters-The-Fray-Legalizing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Enters-The-Fray-Legalizing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Enters The Fray, Legalizing Online Gambling"></a>Pennsylvania Enters The Fray, Legalizing Online Gambling</h1><p>Pennsylvania is the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling, after Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. The law went into effect on Thursday, July 12.</p>
<p>The new law allows casinos in the state to offer online poker, slots, and other casino games to players within Pennsylvania. It’s hoped that the new law will help generate much-needed revenue for the cash-strapped state.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for Pennsylvania,” said Republican state Representative John Payne in a statement. “This legislation will create jobs, generate economic activity and produce much needed revenue for our schools and services.”</p>
<p>Under the new law, players must be 18 years of age or older and must play from within the state. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board will regulate and license online gambling operators.</p>
<p>The move comes as other states are also weighing legalizing online gambling. Michigan has proposed a bill that would legalize internet poker, while Massachusetts is considering a measure that would allow casinos in the state to offer online slots and other games.</p>
<p>Online gambling has proven to be a lucrative industry, generating over $4 billion in revenue worldwide last year. Industry analysts say that the US market could be worth as much as $10 billion per year.</p>
