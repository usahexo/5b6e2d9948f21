<h1 id="How-did-Wilson-help-paddypower-in-Olympique-De-Marseille"><a href="#How-did-Wilson-help-paddypower-in-Olympique-De-Marseille" class="headerlink" title="How did Wilson help paddypower in Olympique De Marseille?"></a>How did Wilson help paddypower in Olympique De Marseille?</h1><p>Paddy Power, one of the world’s leading online gambling operators, was founded in 1988 by three Irish entrepreneurs: David Power, his brother-in-law John Corcoran, and Terry O’Reilly. They set up a small Dublin bookmaking shop called Turf Investments. In 1990, they merged with another Dublin bookmaker, Stephen McCarthy’s Eurobet, forming Paddy Power plc. The company grew rapidly and by 2001 had become the largest bookmaker in Ireland.</p>
<p>In 2010, Paddy Power made an unsuccessful bid to take over its British rival Betfair. The takeover would have created the world’s largest online gambling firm, with a value of more than £1 billion. However, the merger was blocked by the UK Competition Commission on the grounds that it would have resulted in a “substantial lessening of competition” in the UK market.</p>
<p>In August 2013, Paddy Power announced it was selling its Australian division to Crown Resorts for A$280 million. Later that year, the company agreed to sell its Spanish business to Cirsa for €470 million.</p>
<p>In February 2014, Paddy Power agreed to merge with Betfair in a deal worth £595 million. The merged company retained the Paddy Power brand and was headed by Betfair CEO Breon Corcoran. The merger was completed in September 2014.</p>
