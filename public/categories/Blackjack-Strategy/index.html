Developed by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts (EA), this Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) allows players to experience their own, personalized Star Wars story.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that SWTOR is an engaging and visually stunning game but, as with any other MMO, there are always controversies and complaints from some players about various aspects of the game. One of the most contentious issues in SWTOR at the moment is the Contraband Cartel Slot Machine.</p>
<p>The Contraband Cartel Slot Machine was introduced into the game with the release of patch 2.3 in February 2014. This new addition to the game allows players to win rewards such as Cartel Coins, which can be used to purchase items from the Cartel Market, by playing a slot machine type game.</p>
<p>Players are able to use Cartel Coins they have won to buy things like XP boosts, character emotes, armor and weapon skins and mounts. While some people seem to think that this new addition is great fun, others have labeled it as a “pay to win” mechanism that gives those who spend more time or money on the game an unfair advantage over those who don’t.</p>
<p>So is the Contraband Cartel Slot Machine worth getting? Well, that depends on your point of view. If you enjoy playing casino-style games and you don’t mind spending some extra money on SWTOR in order to get some benefits then go ahead and give it a try. However, if you think that this type of mechanism takes away from the competitive nature of MMOs or you simply don’t want to spend any more money on SWTOR than you already have then you may want to avoid it.</p>

Developed by BioWare Austin and published by LucasArts, it was released for the Microsoft Windows platform on December 20, 2011 in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>The game takes place 300 years after the events of the previous game, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords. It features eight class storylines; four for each faction, light side or dark side. Players choose one of these classes at character creation, and then select either the Republic or Imperial faction.</p>
<p>The game was announced on October 21, 2008, shortly before that year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The game was originally planned for release in 2009, but was delayed to coincide with the release of BioWare’s other MMO title, Star Wars: The Old Republic.</p>
<p>As subscription numbers dwindled following the initial excitement surrounding the game’s release in 2011. Bioware offered players who had subscribed since launch a number of in-game items including a special title and a Contraband Cartel Slot Machine. Here we take a look at how to get your hands on this exclusive item.</p>
<p>If you’ve been playing Celebrity Wars: The Old Republic since its launch in 2011 you may be eligible for some free in-game goodies. Among these rewards is an exclusive Contraband Cartel Slot Machine which Bioware has been slowly rolling out over recent months to certain players who have stuck with them throughout their ups and downs.  To see if you’re among those lucky few who qualify for this coveted item all you need to do is check your “rewards” section in your account settings. If you see a message stating that you’ve unlocked the Contraband Cartel Slot Machine then congratulations! You can now enjoy some sweet gambling action without ever having to leave the comforts of your own home.</p>
<p>Assuming that you don’t already have one and would like to get your hands on one of these machines there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of acquiring one. Firstly, it’s important to note that they’re not exactly easy to come by so patience will be key here. Secondly, while there’s no guaranteed way of obtaining one it seems that players who have subscribed to Celebrity Wars: The Old Republic from day one are more likely to be rewarded with the Contraband Cartel Slot Machine than those who have only recently started playing.  Finally, BioWare has stated that they will continue giving away these machines periodically over time so it’s worth keeping an eye on your account settings just in case new rewards become available in the future.</p>

<h1 id="What-Are-the-Odds-of-Obtaining-a-Celebrity-Wars-The-Old-Republic-Contraband-Cartel-Slot-Machine"><a href="#What-Are-the-Odds-of-Obtaining-a-Celebrity-Wars-The-Old-Republic-Contraband-Cartel-Slot-Machine" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Odds of Obtaining a Celebrity Wars The Old Republic Contraband Cartel Slot Machine?"></a>What Are the Odds of Obtaining a Celebrity Wars The Old Republic Contraband Cartel Slot Machine?</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to this question. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the probabilities of various events occurring.</p>
<p>For starters, let’s consider the chances of obtaining a Contraband Cartel Slot Machine in the first place. These machines are obtained through cartel packs, which are random loot drops from certain creatures in-game. The drop rate for cartel packs is believed to be around 0.5%, so the odds of obtaining a Contraband Cartel Slot Machine are approximately 1 in 200.</p>
<p>Next, let’s look at the chances of winning a prize from the slot machine. This will vary depending on what type of prize is being won, but for the sake of this calculation we’ll assume that it’s a chance at obtaining a Contraband Cartel Slot Machine itself. The odds of winning a prize from the slot machine are 1 in 3, so the odds of winning a Contraband Cartel Slot Machine are 1 in 100.</p>
<p>Putting these numbers together, we can see that the overall odds of obtaining a Contraband Cartel Slot Machine are approximately 1 in 400 (1 in 200 x 1 in 3).</p>

Ultimately, it depends on how much you enjoy playing the game and how much money you are willing to spend on it.</p>
<p>If you are a die-hard fan of the Star Wars franchise, then spending your money on a Contraband Cartel Slot Machine may be worth it. These machines offer players the chance to win exclusive in-game rewards, such as weapon modifications, armor, and mounts.</p>
<p>However, if you are not particularly interested in the game or do not have a lot of money to spare, then you may want to consider spending your money elsewhere. There are plenty of other activities that can provide just as much enjoyment as playing Star Wars The Old Republic.</p>
