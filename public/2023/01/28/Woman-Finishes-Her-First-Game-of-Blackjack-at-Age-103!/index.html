      <h1 id="Woman-Finishes-Her-First-Game-of-Blackjack-at-Age-103"><a href="#Woman-Finishes-Her-First-Game-of-Blackjack-at-Age-103" class="headerlink" title="Woman Finishes Her First Game of Blackjack at Age 103!"></a>Woman Finishes Her First Game of Blackjack at Age 103!</h1><p>103-year-old woman, Elizabeth Bell, has reportedly finished her first game of blackjack at a casino in Reno, Nevada. The nonagenarian admitted that the game was indeed tougher than it looked and that it took her a few hands to get the hang of it, but she was ultimately pleased with her performance.</p>
<p>“It was more complicated than I thought it would be,” Bell said after completing her game. “But I got the hang of it and managed to win a couple of hands.”</p>
<p>Bell is originally from Iowa but has been living in Reno for the past several years. She says that she’s been going to casinos ever since she turned 100 and has developed a love for playing blackjack and other card games. In fact, she often takes her daughter along with her to the casino so that they can play games together.</p>
<p>“She’s my lucky charm,” Bell said of her daughter. “I’ve won a lot of money when we’ve played together.”</p>
<p>Despite her impressive age, Bell says that she feels good and has no plans to slow down anytime soon. In addition to playing blackjack, she enjoys spending time with her family and friends, watching movies, and reading books.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep going as long as I feel good,” Bell said. “I’m not ready to stop yet.”</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Woman-Breaks-World-Record-for-Oldest-Blackjack-Player"><a href="#Michigan-Woman-Breaks-World-Record-for-Oldest-Blackjack-Player" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Woman Breaks World Record for Oldest Blackjack Player"></a>Michigan Woman Breaks World Record for Oldest Blackjack Player</h1><p>A Michigan woman has achieved a new world record by becoming the oldest blackjack player.</p>
<p>At 105 years old, Viola Desmond is still hitting the casino floor, where she has been playing blackjack since she was in her nineties. Her amazing feat was recognised by the Guinness World Records organisation in early 2019.</p>
<p>Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1913, Viola Desmond was an entrepreneur and civil rights activist who paved the way for black businesswomen in Canada. In 1946, she made history when she refused to leave the whites-only section of a movie theatre in Nova Scotia. She was arrested and spent a night in jail, but her story made national headlines and helped spark the beginning of the civil rights movement in Canada.</p>
<p>In 2015, Viola Desmond was posthumously awarded the Order of Canada, one of the country’s highest civilian honours.</p>
<p>Viola Desmond is an inspiration to all who know her, and it’s clear that her drive and determination have kept her sharp well into her centennial year. When asked how she feels about breaking the world record for oldest blackjack player, Viola had this to say: “I’m proud - I never thought I would live this long!”</p>
<h1 id="104-Year-Old-Plays-Blackjack-at-Foxwoods-Casino"><a href="#104-Year-Old-Plays-Blackjack-at-Foxwoods-Casino" class="headerlink" title="104-Year-Old Plays Blackjack at Foxwoods Casino"></a>104-Year-Old Plays Blackjack at Foxwoods Casino</h1><p>104-year-old Millie McCoy is not only one of the oldest players at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut, but also one of the most successful. McCoy, who started playing blackjack in her 80s, says her secret to winning is staying calm and never betting more than she can afford to lose.</p>
<p>McCoy began playing blackjack as a way to pass the time and has now become something of a celebrity at the casino. Foxwoods’ general manager, Jason Guy, calls her “a living legend” and says that other players are often in awe of her skills.</p>
<p>McCoy’s advice for new players is to take their time and not get frustrated. She also recommends playing within your budget and only betting what you can afford to lose – no matter how tempting it may be!</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Woman-Sets-New-World-Record-for-Playing-Blackjack-at-105-Years-Old"><a href="#Texas-Woman-Sets-New-World-Record-for-Playing-Blackjack-at-105-Years-Old" class="headerlink" title="Texas Woman Sets New World Record for Playing Blackjack at 105 Years Old"></a>Texas Woman Sets New World Record for Playing Blackjack at 105 Years Old</h1><p>Doris Stevens, a 105-year-old woman from Texas, has set a new world record by playing blackjack at a casino for 12 hours and 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Stevens started playing blackjack at the ripe age of 102 and has been winning ever since. She says her secret to success is “never counting my money when I’m ahead” and preferring to stick to her original $25 bets. </p>
<p>In addition to her world record, Stevens has also won a number of other blackjack tournaments, including one in Las Vegas where she took home a $10,000 prize. </p>
<p>When asked how it feels to be a world-record holder, Stevens says she’s “honored and blessed”. She encourages other seniors to stay active and enjoy life, adding that “anything is possible at any age”.</p>
<h1 id="Woman-in-Florida-Becomes-Oldest-Ever-to-Play-Blackjack-at-106"><a href="#Woman-in-Florida-Becomes-Oldest-Ever-to-Play-Blackjack-at-106" class="headerlink" title="Woman in Florida Becomes Oldest Ever to Play Blackjack, at 106"></a>Woman in Florida Becomes Oldest Ever to Play Blackjack, at 106</h1><p> 106-year-old Florida woman becomes the oldest person ever to play blackjack in a casino, according to reports.</p>
<p>Dorothy Dodd was born in 1911 and has been playing cards for most of her life. On Tuesday, she made history by becoming the first centenarian to sit down at a blackjack table in the Seminole Hard Rock Casino near Tampa.</p>
<p>She wasn’t winning all that much - just $10 over the course of a couple of hours - but casino officials said that was beside the point.</p>
<p>“Even if she doesn’t win, it’s just amazing that she’s here and able to do this,” one employee told Fox 13 News.</p>
<p>According to the Gerontology Research Group, Dodd is now the oldest person in the world to have played blackjack. The previous record holder was 99-year-old Billie Harris from Iowa.</p>
