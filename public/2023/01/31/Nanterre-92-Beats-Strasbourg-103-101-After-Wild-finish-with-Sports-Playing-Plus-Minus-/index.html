<h1 id="How-Nanterre-92’s-Sports-Playing-Plus-Minus-system-gave-them-the-win-against-Strasbourg"><a href="#How-Nanterre-92’s-Sports-Playing-Plus-Minus-system-gave-them-the-win-against-Strasbourg" class="headerlink" title="How Nanterre 92’s Sports Playing Plus Minus system gave them the win against Strasbourg"></a>How Nanterre 92’s Sports Playing Plus Minus system gave them the win against Strasbourg</h1><p>On the 16th of December, 2017, Nanterre 92 played Strasbourg in an eagerly awaited game. The stakes were high, as a victory for Strasbourg would have put them in a strong position to make it to the playoffs, while Nanterre 92 needed the win to maintain their hopes of making it to the Top 16. </p>
<p>The game was closely contested all the way through, but Nanterre 92 managed to pull ahead in the last minutes and win by a score of 89-81. This was due in large part to their Sports Playing Plus Minus system, which gave them an edge over their opponents.</p>
<p>The Sports Playing Plus Minus system is a simple but effective strategy that can be used by any team. It is based on the principle that players should always be trying to move towards the ball and help out their teammates. By doing this, they can not only create scoring opportunities for themselves, but also limit the other team’s chances of scoring.</p>
<p>This system was first developed by coach Vincent Collet of Nanterre 92. He found that his team was much more successful when everyone was working together as a unit, rather than relying on a few star players. By using the Sports Playing Plus Minus system, Nanterre 92 was able to win against Strasbourg and keep their playoff hopes alive.</p>
<h1 id="The-Science-of-Sports-Playing-Plus-Minus-Nanterre-92-Proves-its-Concept"><a href="#The-Science-of-Sports-Playing-Plus-Minus-Nanterre-92-Proves-its-Concept" class="headerlink" title="The Science of Sports Playing Plus Minus: Nanterre 92 Proves its Concept"></a>The Science of Sports Playing Plus Minus: Nanterre 92 Proves its Concept</h1><p>In basketball, the “plus-minus” statistic measures how many points a team scores compared to when a particular player is on the bench. The thinking behind it is that if a team has a low plus-minus, then their opponents are likely outscoring them with the player on the court. Conversely, if a team has a high plus-minus, then they are likely outscoring their opponents when the given player is on the court.</p>
<p>This season in France’s Pro A League, Nanterre 92 has been using this statistic to evaluate their players. With an overall league ranking of 5th (out of 18 teams), they have shown that they are able to effectively use this measure to improve their play. For example, Nicolas De Jong has a league-leading plus-minus of +7.5 per game. While he may not be the flashiest player on the court, his ability to make sure his team is scoring more than their opponents when he is on the floor makes him an important part of their rotation. Other players such as Matt Janning and Makhi Mitchell also have high rankings in this statistic, which shows that Nanterre 92 knows how to use all of its players effectively.</p>
<p>This concept of using plus minus can be applied beyond basketball as well. In football (soccer), for example, clubs can use it to track how well specific formations are working on the pitch. If they note that while one formation is resulting in more goals being scored, another formation is resulting in less goals being conceded, they can switch to the more successful formation for future games.</p>
<p>Overall, Nanterre 92’s success in using the plus-minus statistic serves as an example for other teams around the world that this tool can be effective in improving one’s play.</p>

Specifically, we will be looking at how the sports playing plus minus statistic works in this matchup.</p>
<p>To start with, let’s take a look at the final score of the game. Strasbourg came out on top, winning by a score of 106-86. This means that Nanterre was outscored by 20 points during the game.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the individual players on each team and see how they performed. We can do this by looking at their Sports Playing Plus Minus statistic.</p>
<p>For Strasbourg, Ricky Hickman led the way with a +21 rating. This means that he was 21 points better than the average player on his team during the game. Next up was Jérémy Leloup, who finished with a rating of +19. Other notable players for Strasbourg include Johan Petro (+15) and Mathias Lessort (+14). </p>
<p>For Nanterre 92, Ladawan Wattanakul led the way with a rating of -21. This means that he was 21 points worse than the average player on his team during the game. Next up was Tyrone Wallace, who finished with a rating of -14. Other notable players for Nanterre 92 include Raphael Desrosiers (-10) and Jason Rich (-9). </p>
<p>As we can see, Ricky Hickman had by far the best performance for his team in this matchup. He was 21 points better than the average player on his team, while Ladawan Wattanakul was 21 points worse than the average player on his team. This illustrates how Sports Playing Plus Minus works in basketball games.</p>
<h1 id="Nanterre-92-uses-Sports-Playing-Plus-Minus-to-their-advantage-beats-Strasbourg"><a href="#Nanterre-92-uses-Sports-Playing-Plus-Minus-to-their-advantage-beats-Strasbourg" class="headerlink" title="Nanterre 92 uses Sports Playing Plus Minus to their advantage, beats Strasbourg"></a>Nanterre 92 uses Sports Playing Plus Minus to their advantage, beats Strasbourg</h1><p>Nanterre 92 dominated Strasbourg on both ends of the floor en route to an easy 92-68 victory. Nanterre 92 was led by their star point guard Mamadou Samb, who finished with 18 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists.</p>
<p>Samb’s backcourt mate Boniface Ndong had a big game as well, scoring 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting to go alongwith 5 rebounds and 4 assists. Strasbourg was led by forward Leo Westermann, who scored 16 points on 7-of-15 shooting. However, the rest of Strasbourg’s players combined to shoot just 15-of-51 from the field (29%).</p>
<p>Nanterre 92’s Sports Playing Plus Minus system was a big reason for their victory. The system helps them take advantage of mismatches on both ends of the floor. For example, Samb can easily take advantage of smaller guards defensively, while Ndong can overpower forwards offensively.</p>
<p>This system has been a big reason for Nanterre 92’s success this season. They are currently in second place in the French League with a record of 12-5. Nanterre 92 will look to continue their winning ways when they face off against third place Monaco next week.</p>
