        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-The-Way-In-Legalized-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-The-Way-In-Legalized-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads The Way In Legalized Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Leads The Way In Legalized Online Gambling</h1><p>Nevada has been a hub for gambling activity in the United States for many years. This is due, in part, to the fact that Nevada was one of the first states to legalize gambling. In fact, gambling was legalized in Nevada all the way back in 1931.</p>
<p>More recently, Nevada has been at the forefront of the movement to legalize online gambling. In 2013, Nevada became the first state to pass a law legalizing online gaming. The law allows casinos in Nevada to offer online poker and other casino games to residents of the state.</p>
<p>The passage of this law was seen as a major victory for the online gambling industry. It showed that states were willing to legalize online gambling, and it pave the way for other states to follow suit.</p>
<p>Since then, several other states have legalized online gambling. These states include Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. All of these states have passed laws that allow casinos within their borders to offer online gambling games to their residents.</p>
<p>It is believed that more states will follow suit in the coming years. This is because there is growing support for online gambling among lawmakers and the general public. The growth of mobile gaming has also helped to fuel this trend, as more people are now comfortable playing casino games on their phones and tablets.</p>
<p>As more and more states legalize online gambling, it is likely that we will see a significant increase in revenue from this industry. This is good news for casinos and players alike, as it means that players will have more options when it comes to playing casino games online.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-becomes-Second-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-becomes-Second-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware becomes Second State to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Delaware becomes Second State to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>On June 5, 2018, Delaware became the second state in the US to legalize online gambling. This move comes after the US Supreme Court repealed the federal ban on sports betting in May.</p>
<p>The new law allows players 21 and over to gamble on casino games, including slots, table games and poker, through approved platforms such as casinos, racetracks and off-track betting facilities. Players must be physically located in Delaware to place bets.</p>
<p>Prior to the repeal of the federal ban, only Nevada offered legal online gambling. Since then, a number of states have introduced or passed bills legalizing some form of online gambling.</p>
<p>Delaware’s new law is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year. It is also expected to create hundreds of jobs in the casino and technology industries.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Becomes-Third-State-To-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-Becomes-Third-State-To-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Becomes Third State To Legalize Online Gambling"></a>New Jersey Becomes Third State To Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>On Thursday, October 25th, 2018, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law legalizing online gambling in the state. This makes New Jersey the third state in the US to legalize online gambling, following Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law allows for both internet poker and casino games to be played from within New Jersey’s borders. Players must be physically located in the state in order to participate. However, out-of-state players will also be able to bet on New Jersey’s online casino games.</p>
<p>Governor Murphy stressed that the new law would create jobs and bring additional revenue to the state. “This is about generating revenue for our state, creating jobs in our state, and bringing people back into our casinos,” he said at a signing ceremony.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s online gambling market is expected to generate $260 million in revenue in its first full year of operation, according to industry analysts. That number is expected to grow over time as more people become comfortable with gambling online.</p>
<p>The new law goes into effect on January 23rd, 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-and-California-Poised-to-Follow-Suit"><a href="#Pennsylvania-and-California-Poised-to-Follow-Suit" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania and California Poised to Follow Suit"></a>Pennsylvania and California Poised to Follow Suit</h1><p>Pennsylvania and California have both signaled their intent to follow the lead of Massachusetts in legalizing recreational marijuana. Both states have budgetary concerns that are being addressed through the potential taxation of marijuana sales.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania legislature is currently considering a bill to legalize recreational marijuana. This bill was introduced by State Representative Jake Wheatley back in February. The Republican leadership in the state has been hesitant to support the bill, but that may be changing.</p>
<p>Governor Tom Wolf has come out in favor of legalization and he is working with the legislature to come up with a proposal that can pass. One sticking point is how much money the state can bring in through taxes on marijuana sales.</p>
<p>The state is looking at an estimate of $580 million per year if it legalizes recreational marijuana. That could go a long way in helping to address Pennsylvania’s budgetary woes.</p>
<p>California is also looking to legalize recreational marijuana in order to help its budget crisis. There has been some speculation that California might wait until after the November elections to pass the bill, as it could bring in more tax revenue then.</p>
<p>So far, there does not appear to be any opposition to legalizing marijuana in California. The only question seems to be how much money the state will bring in from taxes on sales.</p>
<p>Both states are facing significant budget crises and are looking for ways to increase tax revenue. Legalizing recreational marijuana appears to be a viable solution for both states.</p>
<h1 id="More-States-Poised-To-Legalize-Online-Gambling-in-Wake-of-Nevada-Delaware-Decisions"><a href="#More-States-Poised-To-Legalize-Online-Gambling-in-Wake-of-Nevada-Delaware-Decisions" class="headerlink" title="More States Poised To Legalize Online Gambling in Wake of Nevada, Delaware Decisions"></a>More States Poised To Legalize Online Gambling in Wake of Nevada, Delaware Decisions</h1><p>The recent decisions by the states of Nevada and Delaware to legalize online gambling have led to speculation that more states will follow suit. The fact that online gambling can now be conducted in a regulated environment is seen as a major step forward for the industry, and it is expected that this will lead to increased revenue for the states involved.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why online gambling is likely to be legalized in more states in the near future. Firstly, there is growing public acceptance of online gambling, with many people seeing it as a convenient way to enjoy their favourite casino games. Secondly, there is evidence that regulating online gambling can bring significant economic benefits to states, as has been shown by the experience of Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>Finally, the decision by the US Department of Justice to rescind its 2011 opinion that online gambling was illegal has removed a key obstacle to legalization. This change in policy means that states are now free to regulate and tax online gambling within their borders, which should provide a boost to state revenues.</p>
<p>All of these factors suggest that online gambling will continue to grow in popularity, and that more states will legalize it in the near future. This should lead to increased revenue for state governments, and a better experience for players who enjoy gambling online.</p>

        <h1 id="8-States-Have-Officially-Legalized-Online-Gambling"><a href="#8-States-Have-Officially-Legalized-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="8 States Have Officially Legalized Online Gambling"></a>8 States Have Officially Legalized Online Gambling</h1><p>Within the United States, there are eight states that have now legalized some form of online gambling. At this point, it’s legal to gamble online within these states: Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Louisiana.</p>
<p>The first state to legalize online gambling was Delaware in 2013. The process for legalization began when the state’s Senate passed a bill that allowed for both casino games and poker to be played online. Not long after, Nevada followed suit and also legalized both casino games and poker.</p>
<p>New Jersey was the next state to legalize online gambling and they did so by passing a bill that permitted casinos in Atlantic City to offer games such as slots, blackjack, and roulette to players within the state.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania legalized online gambling in October 2017. The state permits both casino games and poker to be played online and it’s estimated that there are around 2 million Pennsylvanians who participate in some form of illegal gambling each year. So far, the Pennsylvania lottery is the only organization that has applied for an internet gaming license. </p>
<p>Michigan was the next state to legalize online gambling and they did so with a bill that allows for both casino games and poker to be played on websites operated by licensed providers. The law went into effect in December 2018 and Michigan is currently in the process of developing regulations for licensing these websites.</p>
<p>Indiana became the sixth state to legalize online gambling when Governor Eric Holcomb signed a bill into law in March 2019. The new law allows both casino games and poker sites to be offered through licensed providers. </p>
<p>Illinois followed suit in June 2019 when Governor JB Pritzker signed a bill into law making it legal for residents of Illinois to gamble on approved sites. This law allows for both casino games and sports betting to take place online.  </p>
<p>Louisiana was the most recent state to legalize online gambling when Governor John Bel Edwards signed a bill into law in July 2019. The new law allows people living within Louisiana borders to gamble on approved websites offering casino games, poker, or sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-The-Way-In-Regulating-And-Legalizing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-The-Way-In-Regulating-And-Legalizing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads The Way In Regulating And Legalizing Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Leads The Way In Regulating And Legalizing Online Gambling</h1><p>In 2013, the Nevada state legislature became the first in the United States to pass a law legalizing online gambling. The bill allowed for online poker and gambling within the state, but did not allow for players to gamble on sites outside of Nevada. This measure was seen as a way to help regulate and control the industry, while also providing much-needed revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>Since then, other states have followed Nevada’s lead and legalized various forms of online gambling. In 2016, Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the US to legalize online casino games. That same year, New Jersey became the first state to legalize online sports betting. And in 2018, Michigan became the sixth state to legalize internet poker and gambling.</p>
<p>Throughout all of this, Nevada has remained at the forefront of regulating and legalizing online gambling. The state has continued to update its laws to keep up with new technologies and trends in the industry. In 2017, for example, Nevada passed a law allowing for mobile gaming devices such as smartphones and tablets to be used for online gambling purposes.</p>
<p>This track record makes Nevada an ideal place for companies in the online gambling industry. With so many states now legalizing online gambling, it can be difficult for companies to navigate the regulatory landscape. But Nevada’s well-established laws make it easier for companies to do business in this state.</p>
<p>Nevada’s leadership in regulating online gambling is also good news for consumers. By legalizing and regulating this industry, states are able to ensure that players are protected from scams and fraudsters. They can also ensure that players are getting a fair deal when they gamble online.</p>
<p>This is important, as not all states have taken these measures to protect consumers. In some cases, unscrupulous operators have taken advantage of consumers by offering fake games or refusing to pay out winnings. By legalizing online gambling, states can provide a safer and more trustworthy environment for players.</p>
<p>Overall, Nevada’s leadership in regulating online gambling has been a great success story. The state has been able to harness new technologies while also protecting consumers from harm. This makes Nevada an attractive place for companies looking to get into the online gambling space, and it also benefits consumers by providing a safe and secure environment for them to gamble in</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Joins-Nevada-In-Allowing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Joins-Nevada-In-Allowing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Joins Nevada In Allowing Online Gambling"></a>Delaware Joins Nevada In Allowing Online Gambling</h1><p>Delaware has become the second state in the US to allow regulated online gambling, following Nevada’s lead. The news was announced by Delaware Governor Jack Markell on Tuesday, with the new law set to come into effect on September 1st.</p>
<p>Under the new law, internet casinos and poker rooms will be licensed and regulated by the Delaware Lottery. Residents of Delaware over 21 years of age will be able to gamble at these sites, which are expected to offer a range of games including slots, blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>Governor Markell is confident that the new law will be a boon for the state’s economy, estimating that it could generate as much as $7 million in annual tax revenue. He also believes that it will create around 100 jobs in the state’s nascent online gambling industry.</p>
<p>The news comes as something of a surprise, as Delaware was one of six states that originally opposed online gambling legalization. However, in February this year the state reversed its position and introduced legislation to legalize it.</p>
<p>Nevada became the first US state to legalize online gambling in February 2013. The move has proven to be a success, with revenues from regulated internet casinos and poker rooms reaching over $20 million in 2014.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Enters-The-Fray-Legalizing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Enters-The-Fray-Legalizing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Enters The Fray, Legalizing Online Gambling"></a>Pennsylvania Enters The Fray, Legalizing Online Gambling</h1><p>Pennsylvania is the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling, after Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. The law went into effect on Thursday, July 12.</p>
<p>The new law allows casinos in the state to offer online poker, slots, and other casino games to players within Pennsylvania. It’s hoped that the new law will help generate much-needed revenue for the cash-strapped state.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for Pennsylvania,” said Republican state Representative John Payne in a statement. “This legislation will create jobs, generate economic activity and produce much needed revenue for our schools and services.”</p>
<p>Under the new law, players must be 18 years of age or older and must play from within the state. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board will regulate and license online gambling operators.</p>
<p>The move comes as other states are also weighing legalizing online gambling. Michigan has proposed a bill that would legalize internet poker, while Massachusetts is considering a measure that would allow casinos in the state to offer online slots and other games.</p>
<p>Online gambling has proven to be a lucrative industry, generating over $4 billion in revenue worldwide last year. Industry analysts say that the US market could be worth as much as $10 billion per year.</p>

<p>Nugget Casino inside Reno took the lead in the 21st minute of the game, as midfielder Alfie Potter drilled the ball low past goalkeeper Kelvin Davis from just outside the penalty area.</p>
<p>However, Southampton FC hit back 10 minutes later when striker Lee Barnard flicked home a header from close range after a pinpoint cross from right-back Frazer Richardson.</p>
<p>And the Saints – League One leaders – completed their comeback with just two minutes of normal time remaining when substitute Adam Lallana smashed in an angled volley following a goalmouth scramble.</p>
